The following optional features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The biggest challenge I had was creating an editable segmented control section. I also encountered unexpected difficulty passing data between view controllers. I credit extensive use of constraints for helping me with the first issue and StackOverflow for helping me with the second.

Finally, because this is my first iOS app, I spent a lot of time becoming more familiar with Swift and the XCode environment.
